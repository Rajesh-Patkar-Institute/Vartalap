Instant Messenger
This application is build to express a design approach meant for: highly concurrent, multi threaded, network enabled, client-server message-collaboration chat application. Currently incorporated with Swing. 
Future versions can be built using various frontend technologies to demonstrate the purpose of messaging framework.

Server Application: 
* Compile the Server project and have the server "RPIANVartalapServer" in running mode and then start clients

Client Application:
* Compile the Client project after the "RPIANVartalapServer" is in running mode. Each instance of the client "RPIANVartalapClient" application shall demonstrate a user chat window for interaction. 

Demo: Use username:"client1" and password:"client1" for client application to login to the Server. Verify interaction between two clients via Server.
